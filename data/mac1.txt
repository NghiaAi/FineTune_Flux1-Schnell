"[trigger] Design a high-resolution McDonald's poster featuring a Big Mac, fries, and Coca-Cola, where a red fuel nozzle pours Coke into the glass. Use a warm red-orange gradient background with spotlight effects. Add the tagline 'Fuel upâ€¦ feel good!' in sharp, bold white and yellow fonts, with a mix of handwritten style for a personal touch. The overall style should be modern, energetic, and brand-driven, with crisp and high-definition text to ensure clarity and impact."
